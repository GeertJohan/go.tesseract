## Installation
First, install tesseract 3.02.02 or later. At time of writing this is the latest version of tesseract, and is not in the ubuntu repository yet. You absolutely need 3.02.02 (or later) as go.tesseract can not and will not work with earlier versions.

Manual tesseract installation is explained here at http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/wiki/Compiling.
